## __MIMOSA algorithm for fast, linear-time clustering of data__

This is a python3 version of my fast clustering algorithm described here:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05425

The code lets you benchmark and compare two clustering methods:
* a simple MIMOSA algorithm which performs clustering in O(n) time; and
* a naive centroid-based algorithm which does clustering in O(n^2) time.

Ideas, comments, feedback are welcome.

Thanks!
